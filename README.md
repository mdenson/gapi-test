# Google API test project
A test project to work with the Google APIs using the web client library [google-api-javascript-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client).  Documentation is there and relies on gapi client code downloaded from Google.

This partial implementation is using the Tasks API.

Have not yet got around to styling as I haven't decided what to use...
